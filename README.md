#zVisual

Implementation of the most common algorithms on 3D reconstruction. Marching cubes algorithm and Ray Casting algorithm can be found here.

It's important to note that this is a demo project implementing the two algorithms by OpenGL. It is far from optimal.

Open source libraries like GLEW, GLFW and glm are used.
